up event listeners (window\n// resize etc...) as soon as the package is imported. Therefore, to defer the\n// side effect from happening until the function is actually being used, we are\n// importing the package inside this function. To minimise the chance of\n// importing the original package inadvertently, we are also re-exporting all of\n// its public interfaces. The re-exports do not cause any side effect because\n// they are plain TypeScript interfaces; meaning they are only used for type\n// checks rather than for code output.\nexport function iframeResizer(options: IFrameOptions, target: string | HTMLElement): IFrameComponent[] {\n    const { iframeResizer: originalIframeResizer } = require('iframe-resizer');\n\n    return originalIframeResizer(options, target);\n}\n\n// We also need to wrap the original `iframeResizer.contentWindow` because\n// similarly the package sets up event listeners as soon as the package gets\n// imported.
