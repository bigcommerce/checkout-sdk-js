# Interface: AmazonPayV2ShippingInitializeOptions

A set of options that are required to initialize the shipping step of
checkout in order to support AmazonPayV2.

When the customer clicks on it, they will be redirected to Amazon to
select a different shipping address.

```html
<!-- This is the change shipping button that will be bound -->
<button id="edit-button">Change shipping</button>
```

```js
service.initializeShipping({
    methodId: 'amazonpay',
    amazonpay: {
        editAddressButtonId: 'edit-button',
    },
});
