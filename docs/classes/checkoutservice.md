Once the customer is successfully signed out, the checkout state will be reset automatically.

```js
const state = await service.signOutCustomer();

// The returned object should not contain information about the previously signed-in customer.
console.log(state.data.getCustomer());
```

**Parameters:**

| Param | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| `Optional` options | [CustomerRequestOptions](../interfaces/customerrequestoptions.md) |  Options for signing out the customer. |

###  submitOrder

▸ **submitOrder**(payload: *[OrderRequestBody](../interfaces/orderrequestbody.md)*, options?: *[RequestOptions](../interfaces/requestoptions.md)*): `Promise`<[CheckoutSelectors](../interfaces/checkoutselectors.md)>

Submits an order, thereby completing a checkout process.

Before you can submit an order, you must initialize the payment method chosen by the customer by calling `CheckoutService#initializePayment`.

```js
await service.initializePayment({ methodId: 'braintree' });
await service.submitOrder({
    methodId: 'braintree',
    payment: {
        paymentData: {
            ccExpiry: { month: 10, year: 20 },
            ccName: 'BigCommerce',
            ccNumber: '4111111111111111',
            ccType: 'visa',
            ccCvv: 123,
        },
    },
});
```

You are not required to include `paymentData` if the order does not require additional payment details. For example, the customer has already entered their payment details on the cart page using one of the hosted payment methods, such as PayPal. Or the customer has applied a gift certificate that exceeds the grand total amount.

If the order is submitted successfully, you can retrieve the newly created order by calling `CheckoutStoreSelector#getOrder`.

```js
const state = await service.submitOrder(payload);

console.log(state.data.getOrder());
```

**Parameters:**

| Param | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| payload | [OrderRequestBody](../interfaces/orderrequestbody.md) |  The request payload to submit for the current order. |
| `Optional` options | [RequestOptions](../interfaces/requestoptions.md) |  Options for submitting the current order. |

**Returns:** `Promise`<[CheckoutSelectors](../interfaces/checkoutselectors.md)>
A promise that resolves to the current state.

###  subscribe

▸ **subscribe**(subscriber: *`function`*, ...filters: *`Array`<`function`>*): `function`

Subscribes to any changes to the current state.

The method registers a callback function and executes it every time there is a change in the checkout state.

```js
service.subscribe(state => {
    console.log(state.data.getCart());
});
```

The method can be configured to notify subscribers only regarding relevant changes, by providing a filter function.

```js
const filter = state => state.data.getCart();

// Only trigger the subscriber when the cart changes.
service.subscribe(state => {
    console.log(state.data.getCart())
}, filter);
```

**Parameters:**

| Param | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| subscriber | `function` |  The function to subscribe to state changes. |
| `Rest` filters | `Array`<`function`> |  One or more functions to filter out irrelevant state changes. If more than one function is provided, the subscriber will only be triggered if all conditions are met. |

**Returns:** `function`
A function, if called, will unsubscribe the subscriber.

Updates a specific consignment.

Note: this is used when items need to be shipped to multiple addresses, for single shipping address, use `CheckoutService#selectShippingOption`.
