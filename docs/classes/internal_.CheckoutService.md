before calling this method.

With spam protection enabled, the customer has to be verified as
a human. The order creation will fail if spam protection
is enabled but verification fails. You should call this method before
`submitOrder` method is called (i.e.: when the shopper
first gets to the payment step).

**Note**: You need to enable Google ReCAPTCHA bot protection in your Checkout Settings.

You need to call this method once the customer has redirected back to
checkout in order to complete the checkout process.

If the method is called before order finalization is required or for a
payment method that does not require order finalization, an error will be
thrown. Conversely, if the method is called successfully, you should
immediately redirect the customer to the order confirmation page.

```js
try {
    await service.finalizeOrderIfNeeded();

    window.location.assign('/order-confirmation');
} catch (error) {
    if (error.type !== 'order_finalization_not_required') {
        throw error;
    }
}
```

**`throws`** `OrderFinalizationNotRequiredError` error if order finalization
is not required for the current order at the time of execution.

chosen by the customer by calling `CheckoutService#initializePayment`.

```js
await service.initializePayment({ methodId: 'braintree' });
await service.submitOrder({
    payment: {
        methodId: 'braintree',
        paymentData: {

require additional payment details. For example, the customer has already
entered their payment details on the cart page using one of the hosted

certificate that exceeds the grand total amount.

created order by calling `CheckoutStoreSelector#getOrder`.
