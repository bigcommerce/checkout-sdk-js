     * Use `stripe.confirmIdealPayment` in the [iDEAL Payments with Payment Methods](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/ideal)
     * flow when the customer submits your payment form. When called, it will confirm the `PaymentIntent` with `data` you
     * provide, and it will automatically redirect the customer to the authorize the transaction.
     * Once authorization is complete, the customer will be redirected back to your specified `return_url`.
     *
     * When you confirm a `PaymentIntent`, it needs to have an attached [PaymentMethod](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_methods).
     * In addition to confirming the `PaymentIntent`, this method can automatically create and attach a new `PaymentMethod` for you.
     * It can also be called with an existing `PaymentMethod`, or if you have already attached a PaymentMethod you can call this
     * method without needing to provide any additional data. These use cases are detailed in the sections that follow.

     * By default, `stripe.confirmIdealPayment` will trigger a redirect when successful. If there is an error, or when handling

     *
     * - result.paymentIntent: the successful PaymentIntent.
     * - result.error: an error. Refer to the API reference for all possible errors.
     *
     * Note that `stripe.confirmIdealPayment` may take several seconds to complete. During that time, you should disable
     * your form from being resubmitted and show a waiting indicator like a spinner. If you receive an error result,
     * you should be sure to show that error to the customer, re-enable the form, and hide the waiting indicator.
